Requirement

This program is suitable for MATLAB R2009b and above versions.

In order to make this program executable, users need to do something in the following:
First, one should require the benchmark data to Dr. F. Geraci (filippo.geraci@iit.cnr.it) and refer to his paper: Geraci, F., 2010. A comparison of several algorithms for the single individual SNP haplotyping reconstruction problem. Bioinformatics 26, 2217-2225.
Second, one also should download the software fpgrowth.exe that can mine frequent item sets from Christian Borgelt's Web Pages. http://www.borgelt.net/fpgrowth.html 
In this program, the 64 bit Windows console executable version is used.
Third, one should download the software hmetis.exe for partitioning hypergraphs from George Karypis's Web Pages. http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/hmetis/download
In this program, hmetis-1.5.3-WIN32.zip is used.
After obtaining these files, users should put them in the same folder with this program, and modify the file path in the program. The main program is HGHap.m.
